# Final Project Intro to Programming CSCI 1105

## Synopsis
This program uses parallel arrays to simulate an external database file.  It then offers the user 3 sorting options and keys the file display to their selection.  Would eventually have a file as input and possibly a write feature as well.

## Motivation
Primarily for my final project in Intro to Programming (Java).  Used primarily by educators to spot struggling students either through an attendance sort or grade average sort.

## How to Run
Final_Project_CSCI_1105 java in src folder is the main program.  Simply run the Java.  File (Array) Sort.png

## Code Example
External File Simulation Code.
```
		//  File setup.  Field names and values.
		String [] lastName = {"Flay", "Brown", "Jones", "Peters", "Ash"};
		String [] firstName = {"Bubba", "Lisa", "Scott", "Doug", "Shay"};
		double [] attendence = {78, 99, 60, 93, 80};
		double [] gradeAverage = {68, 99, 89, 75, 45};
```

## Tests
Does not have value returning methods.  Instead it modifies indices to sort the simulated file.

## Contributors
Special thanks to Rocky Mazorow for the field key inferred by method call.
